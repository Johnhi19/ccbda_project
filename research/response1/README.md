## Reproduction of the tutorial

Generally, the code executed with no major issues.

> [!WARNING]  
> ```bash
python /client.py --partition-id 0 --server-address 127.0.0.1:8080
```
> The following code did not execute on my machine properly because of the auxulary `/` in the command line (`/client.py`). This is not a critical mistake, probably just a typo, which can be easlity and quickly fixed.
